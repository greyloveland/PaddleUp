 ### PaddleUp
 
PaddleUp is a mobile application built to connect pickleball players based on skill level and location. The app allows users to create an account, view other players, and form connections with those who have similar experience in the sport. Players can browse profiles, add friends, and coordinate meetups, making it easier to build a local pickleball community.

This project was developed using React Native with Redux for state management and a Django backend that provides structured data handling and API integration.
